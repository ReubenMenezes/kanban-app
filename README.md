This is a Kanban app I made using Claude Code. All the FOSS tools I saw were either too complicated to install for non-tech inclined people, or not available for my OS. I don't want to pay for Kanban software, and I'm sure others don't either, so I vibecoded this. 

# List of Current Features

- Create New Projects
- Create Custom Priority Lists (in addition to the defaults of Low, Medium, and High)
- Import and Export your Data as a JSON file
- Standard Kanban Features (Draft and Drop, Delete, Create New Cards and Boards, etc etc

# Future Plans
None. I made this in 30 minutes for a need of mine. If anybody has any feature ideas, I'd love to hear them so I could try adding them. I couldn't think of any myself, but I'd love to augment this app. 

# How to Use
You can run it from the GitHub Pages link (This app stores data in local storage, and you can export your data as a JSON that you can import whenever you choose).
Alternatively, you can download the files and run this app directly by opening Index.html in your browser. 

Please feel free to fork this app and do whatever you wish to. I made this with AI, it's certainly not my creation to control in any way.


Enjoy!
